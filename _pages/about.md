Hello! I’m Yuexuan Long, a Ph.D. student at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), working in [Long-Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/erping-long-lab/). I completed my B.S. and M.S. at Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), College of Plant Science and Technology, in Academician Zhang Xianlong’s team ([cotton.hzau.edu.cn](https://cotton.hzau.edu.cn/index.htm)). My research began in evolutionary 3D genomics and currently focuses on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, with an emphasis on gene expression noise and its genetic and regulatory basis.

Research Interests
======
- Gene expression noise: features, heritability, and regulatory mechanisms (enQTL)
- Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics; population and statistical genomics
- Evolutionary 3D genomics and epigenomics
- Applying large language models (LLMs) to biomedicine

Research Highlights
======
Ph.D. (human immune cell gene expression noise and genetics)
------
- Built a single-cell gene expression noise atlas from 1.23 million peripheral blood cells across 981 aging individuals, spanning 7 immune cell types. Identified 10,770 distinct expression-noise QTLs (enQTLs), providing evidence that gene expression noise represents an independent genetic trait with potential roles in complex human diseases.  
  - Preprint (Cell Reports in press): bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.29.24318180

Undergraduate and Master’s (plant evolutionary 3D genomics)
------
1. Constructed a pan–3D genome for Gossypium, revealing the evolutionary relationship between transposon-driven genome size variation and higher-order chromatin remodeling.  
   - Nature Genetics: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01237-2  
2. Mapped dynamic 3D genome landscapes under drought treatments, identifying key drought-responsive genes regulated by chromatin dynamics.  
   - BMC Biology: https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-024-01906-0  
3. Demonstrated that structural variants reshape 3D chromatin architecture and may mediate differential expression of homoeologous genes in plants.  
   - Genomics: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.07.023  
4. Authored a review on evolutionary 3D genomics in plants, outlining current progress and future directions.  
   - Trends in Plant Science: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2023.11.009

Future Directions
======
- LLMs for biomedicine:  
  - Knowledge extraction and interpretation for multi-omics datasets  
  - Reproducible pipelines for single-cell/spatial transcriptomics and statistical genetics  
  - Safe, interpretable, and deployable applications
