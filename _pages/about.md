I am a Ph.D. student at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), working in [Long-Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/erping-long-lab/). I received my B.S. and M.S. from Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), where I worked on plant evolutionary 3D genomics in Academician Zhang Xianlong's [team](https://cotton.hzau.edu.cn/index.htm). My current research focuses on the genetic architecture of gene expression noise and its role in human complex traits, using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics approaches.

Research Interests
======
- Genetic and regulatory basis of gene expression noise
- Single-cell and spatial genomics in human disease
- Evolutionary 3D genomics and epigenomics
- Large language models (LLMs) for biomedical applications

Selected Research
======
**Gene expression noise and human complex traits**
- Constructed a single-cell atlas of gene expression noise from 1.23 million peripheral blood cells across 981 individuals. Identified 10,770 expression-noise QTLs ([enQTLs](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.29.24318180)) across 8 immune cell types, demonstrating that expression noise functions as an independent heritable trait contributing to complex disease susceptibility.

**Plant evolutionary 3D genomics**
- Built a [pan-3D genome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01237-2) for cotton species, revealing transposon-driven evolution of genome architecture. *Nature Genetics*, 2022.
- Mapped [drought-responsive 3D genome dynamics](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-024-01906-0), identifying chromatin-regulated stress response genes. *BMC Biology*, 2024.
- Showed that [structural variants reshape chromatin structure](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.07.023) and mediate homoeolog expression divergence. *Genomics*, 2021.
- Reviewed [evolutionary 3D genomics in plants](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2023.11.009). *Trends in Plant Science*, 2024.

Future Directions
======
I aim to develop and apply large language models for biomedical knowledge extraction, multi-omics interpretation, and reproducible computational workflows in genomics research.
